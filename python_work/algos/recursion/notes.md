# Recursion 

## What is Recursion 
The adjective "recursive" originates from the Latin verb "recurrere", which means "to run back". And this is what a recursive definition or recursive function does: It is "running back" or returning to itself. 

### factorial 
This defined in mathematical terms as 
```
n! = n * (n-1)!, if n > 1 and f(1) = 1
```

### English example 
The recursive rule allows a phrase to contain an example of itself, as in 
- She thinks that he thinks that they think he knows that she thinks that ... 

The number of sentences is infinite, therefore the number of possible thoughts and intension is infinite too, because every sentence expresses a different thought or intension.
